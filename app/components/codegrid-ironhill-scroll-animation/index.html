          An underlying field of motion pushes and pulls the image across its
          surface, redistributing pixels in a way that feels organic and
          constantly in flux.

      <p>
        This animation is driven by a real-time WebGL displacement process where
        interaction introduces force into the surface, causing form to bend,
        stretch, and reorganize dynamically. Rather than relying on fixed
        keyframes, the visual state evolves continuously, allowing motion to
        feel organic, responsive, and materially present as the page progresses.
